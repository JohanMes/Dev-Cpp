# Dev-C++

Welcome to the new GitHub repository of the Dev-C++ project!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dev-C%2B%2B

## History

Up until 2004, this project was maintained by Bloodshed software and hosted on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/dev-cpp/

This project was picked up by Johan Mes (the author of this project on GitHub) around 2009 and also hosted on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/

Due to various reasons involving the recent uproar caused by SourceForge hijacking projects to implements ads in people's project I have by way of experiment moved Dev-C++ to Github.

## Branches
- master, contains the most up to date and tested release

- development, contains the latest and greatest builds of Dev-C++, use them at your own risk
